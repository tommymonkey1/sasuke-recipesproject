    <h1>There’s a handful of my “great golden baked crumbed things” tricks on show in today’s recipe:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Oven toast the panko first – it will never go golden in the short bake time to cook the chicken. Don’t kid yourself, like I did for many years;</li>
        <li>Streamlined single extra-strong dredge batter, for better breadcrumb adherence (rather than egg-then-flour dredge);</li>
        <li>Touch of mayo in the batter to replicate “frying” from the inside of the breadcrumbs; and</li>
        <li>Left-hand-right-hand crumbing technique – for clean fingers!</li>
    </ol>
